->what is hibernate;

  -> Hibernate is an framework simplifies the development of java application to interact with the database.

   -> Hibernate is an opensource and light weight.
  
   -> internally hibernate uses ORM tool means object relation mapping. it is programming technique that maps the object data stored in the database.

   ->fast performance means there are two types of cache in hibernate. 1st level cache is enable by default.

   ->Hql means hibernate query language it is independent query language. you dont need to write data base specific queries. for example if u are using mysql database but your requirement to change 
     oracle database it will lead problems incase you use hibernate you can resolove that problem.

   ->Hibenate framework provides the facility to create the tables of database automatically.

   ->Simplifies complex joins means to fetch data from multiple tables is easy in hibernate framework.

-> Hibernate Architecture?
   
   -> The Hibernate architecture includes many objects like persistent object, session factory, transcation factory, connection factory, session and transcation.
 
   -> there are four layers in hibernate
               >java application layer
               >hibernate framework layer
               >backend api layer
               >database layer

-> Elements of Hibernate Architecture?

    Session Factory:  > sessionfactory object build through confuguration object.
                      > Session Factory object holds for second level cache. 
                      > org.hibernate.sessionfactory interface has one method. that method provides objects to session.
                      > one session factory object is heavy weight object. because it stores configuration object and hibernate files data. 
                      

   Session : > The Session object provides time interval between application starts to end. for example if an application contains many sessions.
             > If we want to perform any db operation in hibernate session should be required. session.save();

   Transcation : To perform insert,delete  operation we should being a transcation


-> What is LazyLoading in Hibernate?

   
   
   LazyLoading means improve performance. means in Hibernate 3 onwards lazy loading is enable by default. we no need to write lazy loading is="true" it means not load the child objects when 
   
   parent object is loaded.  

->Difference between get and load?
                                   get                                                                Load
                                   ---                                                                ----
    1. Return null if an object is not found.                                              1.Throws ObjectNotFoundException if an object is not found.
    2. get method always hit the database.                                                 2.load method doesnot hit the database.    
    3. it return the real object not proxy object.                                          3.it returns the proxy object.

-> Difference between Hibernate, ORM and JPA?

   Hibernate: Hibernate is java framework. to interact with javaapplication and database.

   ORM:       ORM is an tool. in internally hibernate uses orm tool. ORM means object releational mapping to map the java objects and data stored in the database.

   JPA:     JPA is a java persistance API . jpa is an specification it will not perform any operation by itself. it is implemented of Hibernate.
            (for example if application uses the java api and implementation of hibernate. if you want to switch hibernate to iBatis it is easy to switch. in other case if you are not use
             jpa api it is very hard  to switch.)
