Junit with Mocking
------------------

->What is Unit Testing?
  Unit testing means process of individual component is called unit testing.

->What is Junit?
  ->junit is a open source framework
  ->Junit means java unit testing

->Assert methods availble in Junit?
  Assert methods for validating the expected result and actual result.

->What is Mockito?
  ->if your component is dependent on some other component then we go for mockito.
    ex:contorller is dependent on service layer.
  ->Mocking is the process of creating substitute object for real object.

->When to use Mocking?
  ->if dependent component are not ready

   ->to isolate our component for unit testing.

there are several mock frameworks availble in market
-----------------------------------------------------
Mock framework are categorized into two types

a)Proxy based mock framework
   Ex: Easy Mock and Mockito

b)Byte code Manipulation based mock framework
              or
   Class Remapping mock framework
    Ex:Power Mock and JMockito

Limitation of Proxy based framework
-----------------------------------
->doesnot support for private methods mocking

->doesnot support for final methods mocking

->doesnot support for static methods mocking

->doesnot support for final class mocking

to avoid the above limitations we are going to use byte code manipulation based mock framework.

@SPY
----
@SPY annotation is used to create real object and spy on that real object.

@InjectMock
------------
@InjectMock annotation is used to be which injection should be performed.
