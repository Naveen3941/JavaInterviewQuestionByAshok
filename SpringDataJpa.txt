What is Persistence Store
--------------------------
->Persistence means storage.

->the place where we will save our data is called as Persistent Store.

Persistent Operations
---------------------
-> Inserting data
-> Updating data
-> Deleting data
-> Retrive data

Persistent Technologies
------------------------

->Persistent technologies are used to develop persistent logic.
->persistent logic is used to perform persistent operations in persistent store.
-> we have several technologies to develop persistent logic
   a) Java JDBC
   b) Spring JDBC
   c) ORM Framework
   d) spring Data

Best Practises to develop persistent logic
------------------------------------------
-> We should maintain persistent logic as separate layer

->In persistent layer we should follow table per dao concept(means every table have one dao class is required)

->if reqired name is more than 30 characters ignore vowels.

Database Installation
----------------------
1) Database Server
2) Database Client

-> In Company environment, DB server will be installed by DB admins in Remote machines.

-> After installing DB server, DB team will share Database details to team members.
       ->URL
       ->UName
       ->Password
       ->Service Name
Persistent Technologies in Java
--------------------------------
1) Java JDBC
2) Spring JDBC
3) ORM Framework
4) Spring ORM
5) Spring Data

Common Persistence Operations
-----------------------------
a)Insert one record
b)update record
c)insert multiple record

-> To perform above operations we need to write methods in Dao interface and
   we should implement those methods in DaoImpl class.
-> if we writing same inserting logic multiple times means it is boiler plate code.
-> if you are connecting only one table then we go for Spring Data but if u are using complex table then we go for other Spring ORM
   technology.

What is Spring Data?
---------------------
Spring Data is a part of Spring Framwork. if you use spring data no need to write
to much of code. 

What is Marker Interface?
To instruct the extra functionality means if you are implementing serilaizble interface the jvm will identified.

->if we create user defined repository interface. then implementation class will be created in run time for our user defined repository interface(Proxy class)
