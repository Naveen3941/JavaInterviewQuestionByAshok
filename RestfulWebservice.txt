-> What is web service?

    we can communicate with different language and different platform.

-> types of web services?

  there are two types of web service
   -> soap
   -> restful 

-> what is soap ?

  -> soap stands for simple object acess protocol.
  -> and  it is xml based protocol for accessing web service
  -> by using soap you will be interact with other programming language application.
  -> soap defines its own security is called ws security. soap is secured compared to restful web services.

-> what is restful webservice?

  ->it is a Architectural style and not a protocol. here there is no protocols means no rules.
  -> Language and platform independent
  ->different data formats xml,html,json,text.

-> what is stateless?
  
   -> whenever client request to server it treats a new request by using http protocol.

-> What is Cacheing?

   -> caching is a process of storeing server response in client side so that client need not to make again and again request to server.


-> Jax-rs Annotations?

  ->@get: it get the data from database
  ->@Post: it is used for create and insert purpose
  ->@put : it Update purpose only we used.
  ->@Deletete: it is used to delete.
  ->@Produces: which format we are given to the server.
  ->@Consume:which format we want to get the data.

There are several technologies are availble in the market to develop distibuted application.
1)CORBA

2)RMI

3)EJB : Ejb is language dependent (only one java application can communicate with another java application)

4)WEB Service: Integration of two different application running on same server or different server is called Webservice.
  ------------
  web service are two types
 a)SOAP based web service
 b)Restful Service
SOAP based web service:
-----------------------
Basic Profile 1.0 released WS-I team.
after that Sun MicroSystem released one api is called JAX-RPC(Java Api for XML based remote procedure call)
it have some drawbacks java 1.5 featueres not supported.

after that Basic 1.1 released WS-I team and sun microsystem release one api is called JAX-WS( Java Api for XML based web service)
We can develop web service in java in two ways
i)JAX-RPC
ii)JAX-WS
if you can develop either JAX-RPC or JAX-WS is an SOAP based web services

Restful Service:
----------------
JAX-RS(Java Api for XML based rest service)
->Unique identity everyendpoint
->it will support different data types like JSON,XML,Text,HTML


 


Why we came into RestfulServices even though we hava SOAP based web services.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------





There are two types of integration
a) Homogenious Integration
b) HeteroGenious Integration

a) Homogenious Integration: if two application are developed by same language is called Homogenious Integration.

b) Heterogenious Integration: if twwo application are developed by different language is called Heterogenious Integration.

Every Http status code will one message
---------------------------------------
1XX    Information
2XX    Success

204    There is no response body means( provider method as return typa as void)
3XX    Redirect
4XX    ClientSideError

404  if data type mismatched
405   http method type mismatched
5XX    ServerSideError

What is Design Pattern?
 
Design Pattern are used to reduce code and time so that application  performance will be improved.

Json : (JavaScript Object Notation)
-----------------------------------

It is the process of Object representation in Javascript language. it takes less memory

-> One pair indicate one object.

->Data must be key and value format only.

->Key must be quoted and value will be quoted if the type of varible is String.

WebService are two types:
-------------------------
->Soap(Simple Object Access Proticol)/JAX-WS(Java Api for XML Web Service)

->Rest(Representaional State Transfer)/JAX-RS(Java Api for XML based Restful Service)

  Rest Stands for Representation means global at
  State means Data
  Transform means Sending and receiveing

Rest: It is process of sending and receiving global data between two application
----

Here golbal formats are XML and Json

-> these two formats can be understand any language like(Java,.Net and other)

-> compare to XML .Json is lightweight 

->XML or Json cannot sent over Network. so rest uses Http protocol to transfer data.

->Sun MicroSystem has provide basic Api for JAX-RS

->Third Party vendors are implemented ex:Jersy

Jersy is ApiOnly for JAX-RS

Jersy 1.X (web.xml based)

Jersy 2.X(Annotation and Configuration)

1st Party -----> SunMicro System (Api for JAX-RS)

3rd Party ------> Vendor( Jersy,RestEasy)

QueryParam:
----------

->These are used to send data key, value format.


Matrix Param:
-------------

->it is also behave like query param but symbol changed ';' and compare to fast.

->How to convert Java Object to Json?
-------------------------------------

By using Jackso api we have to convert java object to json.

HTTP Req & Http Response
-------------------------
