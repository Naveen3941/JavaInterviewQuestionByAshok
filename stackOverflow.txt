What is @EnableJpaRepository?

-> If the repositories package is a sub-package of the Spring Boot main package, then @SpringBootApplication is enough, as it contains the @EnableAutoConfiguration.

-> But if the repositories package is not a sub-package of the Spring main class package, in that case, we need to declare the repositories packages, 
  as shown here:@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = "com.springbootdev.examples.jpa.repositories")
  This has to be provided in a configuration class or SpringBootApplication class.

-> Similarly, @EntityScan can be used if the entity package is not a sub-package of the main Spring application package.
